Hello there!

Thank you for purchasing a theme from Friendly Themes. We're genuinely thrilled with this template - a lot of blood and sweat has gone into making it. Also, thanks for taking the time to read these help docs - most people skip them. We've spent a lot of time making these and we think they'll answer many of your questions.

IMPORTANT FOR YOUR HEALTH AND SANITY

Please open the 'index.html' file in this folder. It has a much better layout and navigation and includes screencasts to *show* you how to do things rather than just *tell* you.


************************************************************************************************************************






If you prefer simple text help, then here's the raw help file broken down for you (you'll find the index.html file much easier to read, though. Seriously, open that up instead)

Documentation for a WordPress theme by Friendly Themes

01 - OVERVIEW

Firstly, allow both of us (Andy and Rich), to say thank you for purchasing one of our themes. We have put an awful lot of effort into making this theme – and the framework behind it – the best in the world. This help document covers pretty much everything you'll need to know about getting the theme installed, what options you have, how to do some of the more seemingly complicated things as well as how to find further help should you need it. We've created several screencasts to help you on your way and plenty of screenshots which will help guide you to your theme nirvana.

So, without further ado, let's take a look at what you've bought, what each folder does and what you should do with them.

When you downloaded your zip package and found this help documentation, you will have noticed that there were several other folders. The "PSD" folder contains all of the photoshop files that you may need if you wish to adjust the graphics we've used on this template.

You'll also have found a folder called "Plugins". In there we've placed the plugins that this theme works really well with. None of our themes require plugins to work. That's really important to remember. However, we've incorporated some popular plugins into this template and packaged them up for you. Please read our note about support for other people's plugins. The directories you see inside the "plugins" folder should go in your wp-content/plugins/ folder. If you're unsure about how to do this, please read the official documentation on installing plugins.

Note: You do not need these plugins, but they might add some extra touches to your site.

You will also have found a folder called "the-theme". In there you'll find, unsurprisingly, the files you'll need to install your new Friendly Themes template. You'll notice a zip file and another folder. The easiest way to install your theme (which we'll get to next) is by using WordPress's in-built theme installer - for that, you'll need the zip file. However, if you prefer to upload your theme to your site manually, then you'll need to upload the entire directory which will be called the name of the theme you've purchased: i.e. "venus". The WordPress.org site has a great intro to adding new themes, if you're stuck.

Note: We use Mac OS X when we take our screenshots and screencasts, so things might look slightly different for you, but the way you do things will be exactly the same.

OK, so, now you know what each item is and does, let's move on to installing your theme.

02 - INSTALLATION 

As we just mentioned, the easiest way to install your new theme is by using the WordPress theme installer. So, log into your WordPress admin panel and navigate to Appearance > Themes.

 
Now, click on "Install Themes" and then "Upload".

Press "Choose File" (or similar) and navigate to where you saved your files. Locate the .zip file in the "the-theme" folder and press "Install Now".

You've just instructed WordPress to upload this theme and extract it into your themes folder. WordPress may ask you for your FTP credentials - if it does, insert those and continue.

Once it's finished uploading and installing, you'll have the option to 'Activate' this theme. Sounds like a good thing to do! Go ahead and click that, and you'll be greeted with a screen which tells you that "this theme comes with an options panel to configure settings." You'll also notice that the theme supports widgets, and there's a link to see where you can place those, too.

 
At this stage, you've diligently installed your new theme and activated it. Awesome.

You should be greeted with a screen something similar to the screenshot on the left ←

As mentioned, things might not look exactly like these screenshots as we have used WordPress version 3.2 on a Mac to produce them - so your admin panel might look slightly different (especially if you're used to the pre 3.2 layout). We also use this documentation template for all of our themes, so it may look like we're installing an entirely different theme - but you're smart, you worked that out already, didn't you?

Note: If you're unsure how to install themes, or you come across problems, then please (re)visit the adding new themes page on the WordPress.org site. It really is a good resource and should certainly help you get up and running.



Note: Having problems playing these screencasts?

03 - SETUP 

OK, awesome, you've installed the theme and you want to start setting up your theme so it looks and works precisely how you want it to. We've tried to make the install process as easy as possible. In each of our themes you'll have at least 2 options (normally 3) - and each of these options does something slightly different.

 
If you've just installed the theme and are still on the screen as per the previous screenshot, then you can go ahead and click on "Options panel" in the yellow message bar at the top. Alternatively, if you didn't see that message and you've gone a bit giddy and gone looking for what to do next, then it's a simple matter of clicking on "Appearance > Theme Options". You'll see a screen very similar to what you see on the left.

Note: Your theme might have fewer or more than the 3 options shown here. Don't panic, each option is explained on the screen, towards the bottom just under "What do these options do?"

The choice is entirely yours as to what you want to do - if you want to set up your site just like our demo, then click on that option. This will go ahead and create some posts, pages and custom post types for you. We'll also set up some default options for you and your site will be good to go. We'll even go ahead and create menu items. Pressing the "Just like the demo" option will, for all intents and purposes, set up your site to be a working version of our demo.

Some people find this option the most useful - as they can get a feel for how we create certain layouts and see what's available. As our framework is so powerful, it might be a bit daunting at first as to what you can do with it - this is where the 'demo' install option comes in handy.

If you've pressed the 'demo' option, go and have a look in your posts/pages - you'll see we've created some for you - go in and edit one. Take a look around, get comfortable!

If you don't want us to create posts and pages for you, then you might want to try one of the other options available to you (you may only have one other). The other options will not create posts and pages, they may set some default options for you, but no content will be created.

Once you know which option you wish to take, go ahead and click the 'dot' next to the left of the name of that option and then press "Save All Changes" at the bottom of the page.

Bang! (in a good way, not like an explosion) You'll now see the Friendly Themes options panel in all its glory. You'll see various options down the left hand side and, well...let's jump straight in...



04 - OPTIONS PANEL 

Great stuff, you've installed and set up your theme and you've now been given a list of options. However, hold your horses. Before you rush off exploring the multitude of options at your disposal, there's a couple of things we need to get right.

 
The first, and probably most important, is to make sure WordPress knows how to handle pretty permalinks. If you've used the 'demo install' option, then we've created a new menu for you - in this menu, we've used the industry defacto permalink pattern of using your website url followed by the name of the page - such as www.mysite.com/page-name/

Now, you may have already changed these, but, because of the relatively complicated things we do behind the scenes to install your theme, we may need to give them an extra nudge again. So, please do pay attention to this step, even if you think you've already done this in the past - you will need to update (or flush) your permalinks.

Note: immediately after you have chosen a setup option, please visit your 'permalinks' page under the settings menu - this will be at a url something like www.mysite.com/wp-admin/options-permalink.php.

If you are unsure what these are, please read the information on that page, select which type of permalink you require, then press 'Save Changes'. Great! Thanks for that.

Now, feel free to go back to your options panel (Appearance > Theme Options) and have a look around. Pressing on one of the tabs on the left (such as 'Home Page', 'Typography' etc.) will then open up the options at your disposal for that particular section.

At first glance, it might look like there are an awful lot of options. Don't worry, I have 2 pieces of good news. The first is that we'll walk you through each of the sections so you'll know what to expect. The second piece of news is that if you're a little overwhelmed, or, if you've bought this theme for a client who you suspect will be, then we have an option which allows you to hide many of the so-called "advanced" options. We'll talk about that shortly. The important thing to note is that you'll very quickly become accustomed to our options panel - it's a nice place to be. And, best of all, once you've done your basic settings, if you don't want to, you don't need to come back. It'll just carry on doing it's thing.



05 - BASIC/GENERAL SETTINGS 

The first thing you'll notice is that, straight off the bat, we'll give you some site-wide choices. These 'general' or 'basic' settings allow you to quickly adjust what your site looks like across all the different posts and pages.

The first few options will be for you to upload your logo. Go ahead and upload your image - we'll resize it if it's too big to fit, so don't worry about that. You can do the same for your favicon and iPhone/iPad icon. A favicon is the 16px by 16px image you see on your browser's tab or toolbar - the small little image which gives your visitors a reminder of your branding. The iPhone/iPad icon is what your users will see on their home screen if they decide to bookmark your site on the iDevice.

 
The next few options may be in a slightly different order, or your theme might not have them if they're not appropriate, so if we describe an option here and you don't find it, don't panic.

Your Main Default Layout allows you to change the quantity and position of your sidebars in general. i.e. You might want to have all of your pages and posts to have a right hand sidebar. Click the image that represents that layout and press save. Done! Pretty easy, right?

If your theme is able to utilise breadcrumbs, then you'll see an option to enable them (not all templates need them, especially 1-page templates). Breadcrumbs give your visitors an extra method to navigate your site. Especially useful if you have several hierarchical pages on your site. If you want to enable them, simply click on the little slider/switch and press save. Job done.

If you have a google analytics code that you wish to be placed in the footer of all of your pages, then go ahead and pop it into the appropriate box. This should look something like UA-1122334-4. You may wish to use a plugin to handle your analytics, if so, you can ignore this.

Note: Don't forget, or perhaps you were unaware, that our themes come with a sidebar manager. This means you're able to decide precisely where your sidebar goes on each individual post or page. Also, you can decide what is shown in those sidebars, again on an individual post-by-post and page-by-page basis. We think that's pretty awesome and hope you do, too.

We have an option for you to be able to allow us to automatically control the size of the images that you upload in certain areas of your site. What this means is that we'll use a clever little script which looks at the size of the image that you've uploaded and resizes it if necessary. This may cause some problems with certain server setups. If you're experiencing issues with this script, please contact your hosting provider and tell them that a PHP image resizing script isn't working - they should know what they need to do (which will basically be to install the "GD Library" which should come as default on any host server with PHP 4.3 or above).

One thing that is important to note, and you'll be informed of this via a message box, is that this script automatically creates a folder and gives it the correct 'file permissions'. What this means is that, the very first time this script is called it will try and create a folder (within your theme's folder) and give it permissions of 777.

If your server host has disabled scripts from making folders, then you will need to create it manually. If you need to do this, you will need to create a folder called "cache" (all lower case) in the "inc" folder in your theme's folder. You should be able to find this in wp-content/themes/themename/

You will then need to give this folder global write permissions or "777" in unix parlance. You will also need to make sure that the inc/ folder is also given the same permissions.

If this is all complete gobbledegook to you, then please read the excellent article on the WordPress.org site entitled "Changing File Permissions"

Note: If you're having problems with your images not resizing properly or not showing, please read and re-read the paragraphs above. There is no way we can realistically create something that will work across every different type of server setup - and there's certainly no way for us to test on them. The script that we've used is an industry-standard, so should work on most hosts. We'll do our best to help you out, but there might be nothing we can do and you may have to manually resize your images before you upload them. That's the last resort, though (and hey, it means your site will still look awesome!)

On most of our themes, you will also find an option to 'Hide Advanced Theme Options'. If you turn this on, then we'll reduce the amount of 'options' you have to the bare minimum. Some argue that we could "do away" with these options if you're able to ignore them, but we've found that some people like to have very fine-grained control over their websites whilst others prefer a quick and easy process. So, we catered for both. If you enable this option, you'll be informed that you will need to press 'Save all changes' and then refresh. So, go ahead and do that. We'll wait.

Done that? Excellent, now you'll see that your sidebar which was once full of options has been reduced to just the minimum. In general, you'll only have the basic settings which you are now familiar with, the sidebar manager, a maintenance option and import/export controls. We'll get to each of these in turn, but for now, you can bask in the glory of fewer options.

Note: If you decide you want to show the advanced options again, then just turn off the 'Hide Advanced Theme Options', save and refresh - all will be returned to their former glory. *phew*



06 - YOUR HOME PAGE 

Every theme is different. Irregardless of whether they are Friendly Themes or not and your home page is no different. In almost all circumstances your home page is the most important page on your site and we like to offer you as much flexibility as we can. All of our theme's have different home pages, so generic 'help' just doesn't really work.

All of our themes do come with a 'Home Page' tab on our options panel and we've included all of the relevant help information that you'll need on that tab. Please go to Appearance > Theme Options > Home Page to see all the relevant information.

07 - LAYOUTS 

All Friendly Themes come with different layout possibilities. That being said, some themes will have more options than others. For example, our first theme, Mercury, is a very flexible design with lots of default layouts and the ability to create an infinite amount from within the WordPress visual editor. Whereas one of our various other themes may only lend themselves to having limited layout options.

However, the premise is the same for each of our premium templates. And, as we've repeatedly said already, these screenshots may vary from your actual theme, but the underlying ideas will be the same.

If your theme has the option of having individual pages (i.e. it's not a 1-pager) then you'll have several layout possibilities. Normally this includes having a left hand sidebar, a right hand sidebar or no sidebar at all. Some of our themes allow you to have a sidebar either side of your content.

The 'Main Default Layout' option on the 'General' or 'Basic' settings tab will be exactly that - a default. If you don't select a layout for a new page you create, then it will use that option.

As with all modern WordPress themes, we've included several 'Page Templates' for you to use, which will allow you to easily select how you want that page to look. Also, as with all of our themes, we have the sidebar manager in your theme options panel, so you can create individual sidebars for each page or post. (More on those shortly).

If you want to quickly create a page, then go ahead and do so, and if you want to select a slightly different layout to your default, then simply choose a page template from your "Pages > Add New" screen. (You'll find it in the 'Page Attributes box'

 
However, the power of our themes really comes into effect when you want to create your own layouts. With our shortcode manager. You can create almost limitless templates for your content using a combination of columns, typographic styles, tabs and sliders. All of these can be combined with a default page template - so you can have a sidebar if you wish - or just use the whole page as a new template.

If you can imagine a layout, you can create it with our shortcode manager. The beauty of it isn't that you are able to visually create amazing layouts, or even that your options are practically limitless. What is truly wonderful is that when you create your layouts, they're not made in hard-to-remember shortcodes. They're created in HTML. This means that, should you in the future wish to change themes, then your content will remain accessible - it isn't locked into proprietary shortcodes. On top of that, you wont need to write any HTML yourself - our shortcode manager does it all for you. You just tell it how you want things to look, or what options you want.

And...on top of all that, if you decide to use a slider, accordion etc. then the javascript that is needed to run those is loaded onto your page automatically. But we don't load it unnecessarily. If and only if you put a slider/accordion/map onto a page, will we load the code for it. This means your site will load faster and not hog resources - meaning happier visitors.

Oh, did we mention that for things such as columns, you'll also be able to see them as you build in the WordPress visual editor? No more guessing what things look like. No more having to 'preview' your page over and over again. Lay it out once. True wysiwyg.



08 - SIDEBARS 

All Friendly Themes WordPress templates come with a sidebar manager. Gone is the day where you have 1 sidebar and that's your lot. With our options panel you have fine grained control over sidebars on a page-by-page and post-by-post level.

It's also incredibly easy to create and set up sidebars. You don't need any extra plugins or even need to venture any further than your options panel. It's baked right in. Like it should be.

 
To be able to use a sidebar on your site, you first need to create it (obvious, when you think about it). So, navigate to "Appearance > Theme Options" and then click on 'Sidebars'. You'll be greeted with a very simple screen - creating sidebars is simple, after all. We've put a demo one in for you already, feel free to change its name and press 'Save All Changes'

If you want another one, go ahead and press 'Add Sidebar' in the top right. This will, err, add a sidebar. Change the name again, if you like, and press 'Save All Changes'. It can't be that simple, can it? Well, let's find out.

Now you've created your sidebars, you'll want to fill them with some widgets, wont you? I thought so. So, navigate to "Appearance > Widgets" just as you would for any normal sidebar.

Loe and behold! The sidebar(s) you've just created are now ready and waiting for you to fill them. So, go ahead and drag some widgets into your new custom sidebar(s). Awesome job.

The last thing you need to do is tell your posts/pages that you want to use your new sidebar. Doing so is very simple - go and edit your post/page (or Add a new one if that's what you're doing) and scroll down until you see 'Sidebar Management'. If, for some unbeknownst reason, you can't see 'Sidebar Management' then WordPress has probably, rather handily, decided to not display this box. It's dead simple to get it back though - in the top right hand corner of your screen you'll see 'Screen Options' click that and you'll see some checkboxes slide down. 'Sidebar Management' will probably be unchecked. Sort that out, will you? Loving your work. BAM! There's your sidebar manager. So, select the sidebar you want to use, press 'update' (or 'publish') and go and have a look at your page - custom sidebar goodness!

Note: WordPress has a tendency to 'hide' metaboxes on a whim. If you think you're missing something, chances are, if you pop open the 'screen options' you'll find your problem.



09 - TYPOGRAPHY & FONTS 

All Friendly Themes templates come with the ability to adjust the typographic layout and fonts used within them. With the advent and subsequent proliferation of Web Fonts, we felt it best to give you as much control as possible. Therefore, we don't explicitly mark certain elements of the site as 'adjustable' - simply because, they are all adjustable.

If you want to be able to change the fonts of your site, it is important to understand the implications of doing so. Not all browsers can display web fonts 'properly', heck not even all Operating Systems can. We recommend doing a little bit of reading before you embark on a voyage of changing your fonts and as such, here's some resources:

Google WebFonts/Font Directory vs. sIFR vs. Cufon vs. others for Design & SEO
Google Web Fonts
10 Great Google Font Combinations You Can Copy
As you can see, you need to be careful with the choices you make with regards to the fonts on your site. If however you're feeling comfortable and want to carry on, then let's get on with an example of what to do.

 
From your options panel (Appearance > Theme Options) click on 'Typography'. The first box is for loading the fonts you wish to use - hey you can't use 'em if you 'aint got 'em. So, we'll use Google Fonts as an example. Pop on over to http://www.google.com/webfonts and select a font. For this example, we're going to use 'Lora' by Cyreal.

Now, click on 'Use this font' and you'll see that Google tells you that you need to put the 'following code as the first element in the head of your document. Well, that sounds complicated, so we've made it nice and easy for you. Copy and paste that line of code - the one that starts with "link href='..." into the first box in your typography settings tab. You should now have something a little like the screenshot above. You're half way to having your own fonts on your site.

<link href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lora&v1" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
The next step is to tell your theme exactly where you want to use this font. Google, rather helpfully, gives you a bit of a clue as to what you need to do. You're adding a little bit of CSS code to your theme, but, if you have taken the time to understand web fonts, then we suspect you will have at least rudimentary knowledge of css.

So, let's say you want to make all of the <h2> elements use this font. Well, in the second box you would put something like:

h2{ font-family: "Lora", arial, serif !important; }
This, basically, says "when I come across a <h2> element, I'm going to try and use the 'Lora' font. If I can't use that for some reason, then I'm going to use Arial, and if that doesn't work, I'll use the default serif font. Oh, and this is important, please make sure you do it... (hence the '!important')"

Your options are practically limitless and it's down to your imagination as to what you can come up with! Get experimenting, but make sure you understand what it is you're doing. We've carefully designed the typography of this template to be as generic, readable and accessible as possible, but we want you to have the choice of how your site looks. Use with caution.



10 - COLOUR SCHEMES 

Some of our themes come with a colour scheme variation. Changing to a different colour scheme is as simple as going to 'Appearance > Theme Options' and then clicking on the 'Colours' tab and selecting the colour scheme you want from the dropdown. Save All Changes and BAM! Different colour scheme is live on your site. Pretty awesome, huh?

 
If you want to be a little bit more adventurous, you can select 'Custom' from that drop down. Once you do so, a list of new options will appear for you to fill in. Each one will be relatively self-explanatory and are individual to each theme. However, for the sake of clarity, you will be given a list of colour pickers, each with a description next to it. Go ahead and select the colour you want for that particular item and go click on save. It really is as simple as that.

For the really adventurous, in this section, you'll also find a custom CSS box. In here, if you know your ID from your sibling selector then you can edit all you like to your heart's content.

The simple matter of fact is thus: You can have, almost literally, infinite combinations of colours on your site. We've tried to make it as easy for you as possible, heck, if you're a developer, even the colour scheme css files are small and easy to read. It's even really easy to add your own 'default' colour scheme to the dropdown - if you want to know how, let us know and we'll happily show you how as it takes 60 seconds to do.

Note: in order to use the 'Custom CSS' box effectively, you will need at least a rudimentary knowledge of CSS. We wont take support requests asking for in-depth adjustments to the site's CSS as that is classed as 'custom work'. We think that's fair enough and hope you do, too.



11 - SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMISATION (SEO)

Search Engine Optimisation, or SEO for short, is one of the hardest things to 'get right' on a website yet, arguably, is the single most important aspect. There are many pitfalls, possible problem areas and all manner of scenarios where you can shoot yourself in the foot.

Fortunately WordPress, by default, is pretty good at getting you on the way to having an optimised site. The core developers would argue that it is built with SEO in mind. However, nothing can ever be 'perfect' and you can always improve upon the solid foundations laid by the wonderful WordPress developers. As with most things with WordPress there are some amazing plugins which can enhance your site - several of these are aimed solely at improving the SEO of your site.

Our stance on SEO is simple - we'll do the core things right, allow you to do what you want - and get out of the way of plugins. We could spend hundreds of hours writing code that amazing people have already written. So why would we do that? Well, we wouldn't. That would be silly.

 
You may already be familiar with some of the fine SEO plugins for WordPress. Plugins such as All in One SEO, HeadSpace2, Platinum SEO and last, but certainly not least, WordPress SEO by Yoast.

All of these plugins have their merits. However, we have a preference, mainly based on past experience, towards WordPress SEO by Yoast.

This particular plugin is free. It's simple. It's coded well. It gives brilliant results. It's feature-packed. It does what it needs to do (and, in many cases, so much more). So, if you're interested in improving the SEO of your site, you should go and download and activate that plugin, read the documentation, set it up appropriately and enjoy your site being better at SEO.

We've included the WP SEO plugin in your download, but Yoast is a very active developer, so it might not be the most up-to-date version. Make sure you're up with the times and using the latest version.

By default, we'll give you the option to change the meta description on the home page as well as the title of the home page - both very important things to get right.

The description on your home page is vital for SEO. Generally 25 to 30 words using no more than 155 characters. It should always be part of your SEO Strategy to ensure that the description is relevant to the content on the page.

You can also add Portfolio items to the site search results and the RSS Feed - this wont happen by default - so, if you like, go ahead and activate those options on this screen.

12 - IMPORT/EXPORT OPTIONS

Have you bought an extended license for one of our themes? Or are you developing locally and then want to transfer all of your settings to your live site? Either way, we've got you covered. It'd be a nightmare having to go through each of the options, one-by-one making sure your local copy is the same as the one on your live site, wouldn't it?

So, instead, go to your theme options panel and hit the Import/Export tab. In there you'll see 2 buttons, and 2 boxes. They're pretty self-explanatory, but, just for clarity, we'll walk you through them.

 
The 'generate options' button will do exactly that. It will fill the box above with a copy of your existing options. It might look a little weird, but don't worry, when it comes to 'importing' them, your theme will know what to do with them.

You'll also notice an 'E-mail me these options' button. It'll be 'inactive' at first - well, you need to generate some options before you can e-mail them to yourself, don't you? So, go ahead, press that 'generate' button.

Now you'll see that the e-mail button has activated. Pressing this, will, well...you guessed it, e-mail you a copy of those options. It will send them to the e-mail address you used for the account you logged in with.

The 'e-mail' button is designed as a backup procedure. You don't need to do this, but well, having backups is always a good idea.

Note: This only backs up your theme's options. Nothing else. No database. No theme or plugin files. Just your theme options.

Once you have a copy of your options, you are able to 'import' them into another copy of this theme. Please don't try and copy options between different themes - that'll cause all manner of headaches. You don't want to do that. However, if you have 2 copies of the same theme, then by all means, paste your options into the 'bottom' box, and press save all changes.

As if by magic, your theme options will be transferred.

Important Note: As with any 'database related' tasks, you should always take a back-up of your site before performing said tasks. There are loads of plugins that help you out with these (our favourite is WordPress backup, and the WordPress Codex has an excellent article on how to manually back up your site.

13 - THEME UPDATES

We absolutely love getting feedback on our themes - whether it's positive, a feature request or a bug report. We're human, we make mistakes - but we'll do our absolute damnedest to try and prevent them but if one slips through, we'll update our theme as soon as possible.

 
But, how are we meant to e-mail everyone who purchases our theme when we release an update? We can't. "So what does that mean?" we hear you cry "the onus is on me to check when you release an update?".

No. We've built in an update script into your theme. It'll tell you, automatically, when we release an update. It'll also tell you what we've updated - in the form of a changelog. So, all you'll have to do is download that new update, install the same way you did the first time, and you're away.

As always, back up first, back up often. You can even do an 'export' of your theme options first- we just covered that above - and then, when you install your new version, you can import them right into the updated template.

When there's an update, you'll get a notification in your sidebar and you'll see a new menu item

Simple. Clean. Effective. Effortless (as we can make it).

Note: Please do back up before you update your theme. It sounds trivial and it might be a pain the posterior, but, you'll be so glad you did back up if you have a problem.

14 - HELP!

You want help? You got help! Not only do we have a 'help' tab in our theme options panel which we update regularly with frequently asked questions and other helpful snippets, we also respond actively our the comments left on our theme's pages.

 
We also are in the process of setting up a support forum whereby our amazing community of buyers can help each other out as well as get answers directly from both Andy and Rich.

We're committed to spending at least two hours a day, Monday-Friday on answering support requests, helping people out, updating our themes, answering questions in comments, building new features as per community request and, in general being rather jolly helpful.

Also, we're not called Friendly Themes for nothing - we'd like to think we give amazing service for our awesome themes. We're told we're really friendly to boot!

If you're really stuck and need an urgent answer, you can e-mail support@friendlythem.es and we'll do our very best to get back to you as soon as possible. You can help us to help you by including as much information as possible about your problem. Here's some really useful things you can tell us:

The URL of the site where you're having problems
Any error or warning message you have received
The browser, version and operating system that you are using
The steps you have taken to come across this problem
Any other pertinent info you think we'll need (a screenshot is always an added bonus)
We'll do our very best to solve your problem, but if it looks like it's a hosting or server problem, or is something outside of the remit of what we consider 'within our control' then we may not be able to directly help - but we'll almost certainly be able to offer advice as to how you can solve your problem.

We may need to have access to the back end of your WordPress installation in order to diagnose your problem and as such, you'll need to create an account for us - with administrator privileges. Don't worry, we promise not to make a mess or snoop where we don't need to. We promise.

In extreme circumstances, it may also be necessary for us to have access to your FTP or Hosting control panel - we'll let you know if that's the case.

If you are having problems playing the screencasts in this help file, then we're sorry about that. We've tried to make them as accessible as possible. You will find them all in the 'media' directory. Each video has 3 different formats, so if you try opening them using your Windows Explorer or Mac OS X Finer window, your computer should be able to play them as stand-alone videos. We'd recommend trying to .mp4 files first, the .webm and .ogv files are generally codecs used in web browsers, but the .mp4 files should be openable in Windows Media Player or Mac OS X Quicktime. If you're still stuck, send us an e-mail and we'll help you out - support@friendlthem.es

15 - ADVANCED OPTIONS

We like to think that our themes are some of the most advanced, technically, in the world. We push the boundaries of what is possible with WordPress, HTML, CSS and Javascript. As such we have quite a few advanced features which, by default, we'll have turned off. This is because they may not work for everyone, in every circumstance. This isn't because we have coded them badly, it's simply because what we're doing is pretty complicated, and as such, not all browsers or operating systems have quite caught up yet.

Most of the advanced options are pretty self-explanatory and the inline help next to each one will suffice in telling you what you need to know. However there are a couple which we want to highlight and explain with further detail.

 
You may have seen our video about our awesome 'real' WYSIWYG editor for WordPress - it caused a bit of a stir when we launched it. If you haven't, then basically it is a feature which enables you to see precisely what it is you are creating right from within the WordPress visual editor. This includes sliders, tabs, accordions, maps etc.

There is a caveat to this feature and that is that it simply will not work in all browsers. At the time of penning this, it only semi-reliably works in Google Chrome version 12, Firefox 5 and Safari 4+. There is nothing extra we can do to make this feature work in other browsers - it is simply down to the way they interpret code being injected into an iframe. If the browser environment changes or a new technique becomes available, rest assured, we'll be the first to know about it and implement it.

Note: We will not be able to magically be able to make this work for you. Some server set ups and some browsers will not allow this feature to work in its entirety.

If you're feeling adventurous then by all means go ahead and click on your 'Advanced Options' tab and turn on 'Show Sliders/Accordions in WYSIWYG Editor' - then go ahead and make a new page or post and add a slider or some other feature. We think you'll agree, that is pretty darn awesome.

You'll also find really cool extra features in this options panel - one of them is the ability to add thumbnails to your "All Post/Pages" screen - if you've set a featured image for that post or page, then if you enable this option, you'll see a thumbnail of that image alongside the id/title/date etc.

Go ahead, experiment away. As always, make sure you back up often and verify that your backups are usable.

16 - THEME-SPECIFIC OPTIONS AND HINTS/TIPS

About your blog home page

If you've chosen to use the non-grid based blog home page layout, here's some hints and tips for you:

If you want your blog post to be 'full width' on the blog home page (especially useful for a video or image) then add a custom field with a key of 'blog_home_no_sidebar' and a value of 'true' (without the quotes). This will then remove the sidebar. If you visit http://venus.friendlythem.es/blog/blog-alternate/ you'll see we do this for the first video post.
If you create a post with a post format of 'link' you will need to put the target of the link as 'The Excerpt'. Once you do this, if someone clicks on the title of the post on the blog home page, they will be taken directly to that link, rather than to that individual post's page.
Some notes about the plugins we have used on the demo:

We have used Viper's Video Quicktags Plugin for all of our videos. It really is a fantastic plugin. Once activated, your WordPress editor screen will have some new buttons for different video websites (such as vimeo and youTube). Simply click on a button, paste in the URL to the video you wish to embed and click on 'ok' - done! You'll get a 'short code' which looks something like: [vimeo width="225" height="132"]http://vimeo.com/18967093[/vimeo] - this will then display the video.
To get videos to work in the sidebar, we made a Text widget and copy and pasted a video short code just like the one above. (You may need to tweak the height and/or width attributes to make them look right.
We use the 'Image Widget' plugin to show an image in the sidebar. For the 'Link' - if you select to point at the full version of the image and 'Stay in Window' we automatically make the image appear in a lightbox when someone clicks on it.
To show Tabs/Accordions on our posts, we use the Arconix Shortcode Plugin. Below is some example code of how we got each type to work:
Tabs

[tabs]
    [tab title="Tab 1"]
        Tab 1 Content
    [/tab]
    [tab title="Tab 2"]
        Tab 2 Content
    [/tab]
    [tab title="Tab 3"]
        Tab 3 Content
    [/tab]
[/tabs]
Toggles

[toggle title="Click here now!"]Toggle cool content on click[/toggle]        
Accordions

[accordions]
    
    [accordion title="Accordion 1"]
        Accordion 1 Content here
    [/accordion]
    
    [accordion title="Accordion 2"]
        Accordion 2 Content here
    [/accordion]
    
    [accordion title="Accordion 3" last="last"]
        Accordion 3 Content here
    [/accordion]
    
[/accordions]
The main menu, submenus and images

You'll notice that in our demo, we have images and 'subtitles' for our menu items. We've made this really easy for you to do and it's all within the familiar 'Menus' page on your WordPress dashboard. So, visit 'Appearance > Menus' - if you haven't got a menu, then go ahead and create on (call it whatever you like, we chose 'Main Menu') and drag and drop the pages you wish into this screen. Ensure you press 'Save Menu' and that you have the menu selected under 'Theme Locations' in the top left next to 01 - Main Menu there is a drop down box - select the menu you have just created and press Save. Now, your new menu appears in the main menu slot at the top of the page.

Now you need to check that your 'screen options' aren't preventing you from seeing some important things. From Appearance > Menus, click on 'Screen Options' in the top right and then ensure 'Description' is ticked.

To create a 'subtitle' you simple need to type some text into the 'Title Attribute' box. Your main 'top level' menu items (the ones that appear at the top of the page should only have a short subtitle, just like ours on the demo. The ones in your drop-down menus can be much longer - in fact, they look more aesthetically pleasing if they run onto two lines.

You also might want to add an image to your submenus. Pretty simple. Upload an image to your Media Library (Media > Add New) and then when it's done copy the 'File URL'. Now revisit Appearance > Menus and then on one of your submenu items, past that File URL into the box marked 'The URL of an icon that you wish to use for this menu item' (it may also be called "Description"). Save and you're done! Nice work!

If you don't want an icon for your sub-menus, then simply enter the word 'none' (without the quotes) into the 'description' box. (Reason for this is WordPress automatically adds a character to this box if you leave it empty and save�weird)

Problems with no dummy content?

If you are more au fait with importing content from a WordPress .xml file, then please feel free to grab it from http://dl.dropbox.com/u/455309/venus_test_data.xml

If, when you install, you don't see any content, please visit Appearance > Theme Options > Advanced Options and change 'Show dummy content' to 'Yes' then save.

Contact Form

For the contact form - you can view the options at Appearance > Contact Form. Simply fill out the To: address (and any others that you desire) and then press 'Save Changes' at the bottom. Now, to include this form in a page or post (or text widget) you simply need to include the short code thus: [TINY-CONTACT-FORM]

Note: Your home page is pretty special. It is a series of widget areas - 6 in total (we only use the top 5 on the demo). This means that you can practically have any combination of layouts and content that you wish. If you want to set things up just like our demo, then check out the screenshot below (click it to get the full version)

 
If you're having trouble viewing that image, please open the image in a separate tab You'll see that even the slider is a widget - that's pretty awesome, we think. It also means that you'll be able to use the sliders in other 'full width' widget areas such as at the bottom of posts (without a sidebar) or on the contact page etc.

So there you have it, the most incredibly powerful home page and it's drag and drop! We think that's pretty awesome.

Please do note that we can't possibly cater for absolutely every possible combination of widgets that you can put in there, we've tried to be generic. If you get stuck and things don't quite look right, let us know and we'll help you out!

Using the anythingSlider like our demo

If you would like to use the anythingSlider like our demo, then it's pretty straight-forward. We've enabled 3 'modes' with this slider. You can either have 'boxed' content, which will be limited to 1140px and be similar to that of the Nivo Slider (which is images-only) or you can have it be 'full-width' - used when you just want a full-width (1600px wide) image or 'full width with content' (in which case the image is a 'background' at 1600px and the content above it is set to 1140px.

Boxed Content

In the post you want to be displayed as boxed, simply use ann 1140px wide image as the featured image. Done!

Full Width Image-Only

In the post you want to be displayed in the anythingSlider simply use a 1600px wide (or more, it'll be resized) image as the 'featured image'. Then add a custom field with key 'full_width' and value 'true'. Done!

Full Width With Content

This one is quite similar to the one above, but you have to curate your content carefully. It's easiest if you put your content into columns using our short code editor.

The basics are to add a custom field with a key (name) of full_width_with_content and a value of true. Then, as your featured image use a 1600px wide image.

In your 'content' we automatically use everything above a "more" tag. You can insert one of these by pressing 'Alt-Shift'T' if you're in the Visual editor (alternatively press the 'more' button which is normally just to the left of the spell check) or press the 'more' button if you're in the html editor.

Your post will now be split into 2. Anything ABOVE the 'more' link will be used on the slider. Anything BELOW the 'more' link will be used when someone views the 'single' post view for that particular post.

Here's an example of one of the slides on our demo:

<div class="column_container">
<div class="one_third">
<h2>Full-width image with content</h2>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim.</p>
<p><a class="friendly_block_button blue tip" title="View our portfolio" href="/portfolio/">Our Portfolio</a></p>
</div>
<div class="two_thirds last">
&nbsp;
</div>
</div>
<!--more-->
<h3>This content is below the more link</h3>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim.</p>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim.</p>
All of that is built using out short code editor. The first thing we did is press the 'more' button. It's important that you leave this on a separate line (all on its own, no spaces or anything else). Next, we went back to the start of that line and pressed 'enter' twice (moving the 'more' link down) and then returned to the top of the editor (i.e. press the up key twice). As we're now ABOVE the 'more' link, this content will appear on the slide on the home page (or wherever you use this widget). We then created 2 columns with our short code editor, or you can use the short code 'codes' (the ones in square brackets). Then popped our content in. Anything you put in a h3 element (that's a 3rd level heading) will be styled with a green background and white text and all paragraph tags following that h3 will be white text on a black background. Feel free to style things however you like.

Needless to say, you can add videos and other content into your slider - just do as you normally would - add the short code or content directly.

After we had finished adding our content, we then went BELOW the 'more' link and added some content which would be shown on the 'single' post view. Added our custom fields (as above) Then save. Done!

The Nivo Slider

Really couldn't be simpler. Add an image as the 'featured' image to a post and save. Done! (1140px wide, of course)
